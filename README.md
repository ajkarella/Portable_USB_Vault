# Portable USB Vault
If you'd like to use this, create a "vault" folder in the same area as the lock and unlock executables. Any files within the vault folder will be encrypted based on your password. I made this in like an hour so it's not foolproof, but I wanted something lighter than other usb encryption solutions. 
   
   
   
Future fixes (if I feel like it):
 - add a check to make sure you don't double encrypt files.

## Directions
Drag and drop "lock.exe",  "unlock.exe", and "vault" onto your usb stick. Then encrypt any files by running lock.exe
