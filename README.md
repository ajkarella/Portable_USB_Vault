# Portable USB Vault
This is a simple standalone file locker. Any files within the vault folder will be encrypted based on your password. I made this in like an hour so it's not foolproof, but I wanted something lighter than other usb encryption solutions. Your password is not saved anywhere, so don't forget it. I'm not responsible if you ruin your files lmao.

Future fixes (if I feel like it):
 - add a check to make sure you don't double encrypt files.

## Directions
Drag and drop "lock.exe",  "unlock.exe", and "vault" onto your usb stick. They are located in the "dist" folder in this repo. Then encrypt any files by running lock.exe. Use unlock.exe to access your files again.
